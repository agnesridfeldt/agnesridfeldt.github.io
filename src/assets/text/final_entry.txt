I just needed somewhere to put it down without trying to make it sound smart. Or like I have a handle on it. No “lesson learned,” no neat ending. Just… what it feels like from inside my own head.
I keep thinking if I write it in order, it’ll make sense. Like I can line the pieces up and suddenly it’s just a normal problem with a normal solution.
It isn’t.
Everything in my life feels rearranged. I feel like someone took the version of me from last year, shook her out, and then put her back wrong. Same bones, different angles.
Aaron first. (Because everything loops back to him, whether I want it to or not.)
People at school think they know him. They see the jokes and all that he is. They don’t see him step into his house like he’s bracing for impact. They don’t hear the kind of silence that isn’t peace, it’s waiting. Like the air is holding its breath.
I used to believe in the posters. The ones in the hallway by the nurse’s office: Tell an adult. Speak up. You’re not alone.
So I did. I picked words carefully. I tried not to sound like I was “accusing,” because God forbid you ever sound too sure about something terrible.
And it wasn’t like in movies. It wasn’t report → consequence → safety.
It was meetings. Phone calls. Serious faces. “We’re looking into it.”
For a minute everything got quieter, but it was the kind of quiet that just means it moved somewhere else. Like the volume got turned down so nobody outside could hear it.
Aaron said this thing once, that belief and safety aren’t the same thing.
I didn’t understand it then.
I do now.
I keep replaying certain images like they’re stuck behind my eyes: the bruises he pretended were nothing. The way he’d flinch at the smallest movement, and the shell he became. The way he’d show up and try to pour all of it into me without saying any of it out loud.
And I let him, because what else do you do when someone you love is standing right there and you can feel them slipping? If he needed my room, my hands, my mouth, my skin—if he needed anything that kept him in his body—I gave it.
But there’s this ugly, honest thought I hate having:
I am not a bandage.
I am not a place to dump pain so you don’t have to look at it.
I’m a person. I’m allowed to want words. I’m allowed to want him to talk to me, not just hold on until he goes numb again.
And then there are the nights where it isn’t just his dad.
It’s him. Making his own mess because it’s the only thing he can control.
Sometimes I find myself thinking something cruel and I don’t even want to write it because once it’s written it’s real:
Maybe I made it worse by telling.
I know that’s not how it works. I know the problem is not me. The problem is not me, or Aaron or his mom. It’s his dad and this fucked up system. I know that. But the thought sits in me like a splinter anyway.
That’s the first half.
And then there is Nat.
She is a constant. A thread. She’s been in my life so long I don’t know what parts of me are mine and what parts grew around her.
I used to think it was just best-friend stuff. But lately it feels like there’s something else in it. Not even a big obvious thing. Just small shifts.
And I can’t tell if I’m imagining it because everything else is already too much, and my brain is looking for patterns and continuity the way it always does.
There are these moments when we’re lying on my bed and she’s half asleep and her arm is heavy around my waist, and my brain does this stupid, terrifying math:
And then I freeze and stare at the wall and do nothing, because I don’t trust myself to not ruin my entire life in one second.
I don’t even know what I want.
I just know I don’t want to lose her.
And I don’t want to lose him.
And I’m so tired of feeling like loving people is a job I’m failing at.
Everyone needs something from me.
Aaron needs somewhere soft to land. Nat does too. Mom needs me to be good. To be the one who doesn’t add weight to the pile. And Sibling needs me to have answers, life experiences, someone who can explain things like they’re simple.
Somewhere in there I forgot I’m supposed to be a person too, not just everybody’s emergency contact.
Here’s what I want.
I want to leave this town. And I am, I am leaving for college.
But before I even have time to blink it’ll be thanksgiving and then christmas and tnen summer.
I want a tiny apartment. I want to make dinner and play music. I want to stop holding my breath all the time.
Sometimes I imagine leaving with Aaron. Driving until the radio changes and nobody knows our last names. I imagine him sleeping without flinching. I imagine him laughing and not checking the room first. I imagine a version of him that isn’t carrying a storm on his back.
Sometimes I imagine leaving with Nat. Sharing an apartment in New York where we argue about posters and split rent and stay up too late watching weird movies and she sits too close and we don’t have to pretend we don’t notice.
And sometimes I imagine leaving alone.
I hate writing that. It makes me sound selfish. Like one of those girls in movies who runs away and everyone’s like “how could she do that to the people who love her?”
But the truth is: I think about everyone all the time. That’s the problem. Caring is the thing that’s crushing me.
If I stay, I keep watching Aaron burn and pretending love is enough water. I keep pretending Nat is just “best friend” when my stomach twists every time she looks at me. I keep being the steady one. The responsible one. The one who makes it easier for everyone else to not feel too much.
If I go, I hurt people I love in a different way. I make them wonder what they missed. What they should’ve done. Could have done.
Just like I do now.
This is about me not knowing how to exist as just me anymore.
I don’t know what I’m going to do. I keep waiting for clarity like it’s going to show up one day in the mail.
Some days I think I can hold this together longer. Leave for college and come back for Thanksgiving.
Some days I stand at the bus stop and my feet feel like they’re already moving and my brain is just behind, trying to catch up.
