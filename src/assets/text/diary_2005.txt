I’m still getting used to writing on this thing. It feels a little too nice for me, like I borrowed it and someone’s going to ask for it back. But every time I open it I realize it’s my own space. I didn’t realize how much I needed that until now.

Last night Nat came around and she brought Ginger Snaps. I liked it more than I thought I would, even though I didn’t totally get all of it. Nat did, of course — she was pointing out these tiny things I barely noticed, like how a shot was framed or how the music changed right before something happened. She always catches details like that. I just nodded along and pretended I saw it too.

Nat did, of course — she kept pointing out these tiny things I barely noticed, like how a shot was framed or how the music shifted right before something happened. She always picks up on that stuff without making a big deal out of it. I just nodded along and pretended I was following.

She stayed over like we’d planned. We talked a little after the movie and then fell asleep pretty much right away.

Today was the beach day. Everyone was already yelling about the cooler when we got there. Aaron showed up a little late, and I did make him pay for making fun of me last night. Pushed him straight into the water. He dragged me in after, and it turned into everyone splashing everyone for no reason.

The rest of the day was just normal stuff. Nat trying to convince us to stay even when we were all tired. Nothing huge, but it felt like the good kind of summer day. The ones you’ll miss when you’re like 40.

Now, I’m stretched out in bed. Tried from the sun in that good way, no siblings begging to use the computer. I keep thinking I should do something meaningful on this laptop, like start a project or write music or something. Endless possibilities. But that can wait, for now I’m just getting used to hearing the keyboard and having somewhere to put my thoughts where no one else can see them.

*June 18th, 2005*
I just got home from Alex’s and I can still smell the smoke from the grill in my hair. It was one of those evenings that didn’t really have a beginning or an end, just kind of happened once everyone was there. We got there a little after seven and people were already eating. Someone had brought way too many chips again, so of course Nat and I ended up with the same bowl even though we didn’t need to.

The food was good, or maybe it just tasted good because everyone was sitting around talking and passing things back and forth.

Aaron got there a bit later and slid into the group like he’d been there the whole time. I didn’t really talk to him one-on-one or anything, but he kept making stupid jokes and throwing bits of ice at people, which was funny in that way he does where you’re not sure if he’s doing it to be annoying or to make someone laugh. I can never tell with him.

He left before the fireworks, which wasn’t that weird but still made the night feel different. The fireworks weren’t amazing anyway. More like loud pops and little bursts of color you could barely see above the trees. Nat screamed at the first one and everyone teased her for it, and she pretended she wasn’t embarrassed.

Bm | G | D | A
 
I heard you calling through the heather,
Like a storm caught in a dream,
And the hills rose up to answer,
Spilling shadows into me.
With a glass-winged little heartbeat,
You were drifting through the blue,
Oh, the sky became a river,
And it carried me to you.

*June 25th, 2005*
It’s only been a little over a month of summer and I’m already bored out of my mind. I should’ve listened to Mom and actually gotten a job or something. Nat’s away with her family, and so is basically everyone else. Aaron’s still in town but he’s busy with his license stuff, so I’ve just been here… doing nothing. It’s honestly pathetic how bored I am. At least he has time tomorrow, so that’s something to look forward to.

Since I’ve had way too much time to myself, I keep thinking about college. I’m already stressed and junior year hasn’t even started yet. I signed up for a million APs, and I have to take both the SAT and ACT at some point, and I feel like everyone else magically knows what they’re doing. I don’t. How is anyone supposed to survive junior year without combusting?

Anyway, maybe I’m just spiraling because I’ve been sitting in my room all day. Hopefully tomorrow will make me feel a little less like a ghost.

*June 26th, 2005*
I just got home from the mall with Aaron. Mom drove me, which felt mildly embarrassing, but whatever. We got food first, nothing fancy, just the usual. He ended up getting us ice cream afterward without making a big deal about it — just handed it to me like it was the most normal thing in the world. It was nice. I don’t know why that stood out to me, but it did.

We walked around forever after that, just talking about random stuff. Music came up (obviously), and I don’t know… he actually listens when I talk about it. Not in the “pretend to care” way people sometimes do. He had Opinions about every song I mentioned and none of them were stupid. It’s weirdly rare to feel like someone gets what you’re talking about instead of just nodding along.

Nothing “big” happened, but the whole evening just felt easy. Comfortable. I didn’t notice how much time had passed until Mom texted me asking where I was. I guess that’s a good sign? I don’t know. Maybe I’m overthinking it because this summer has been so boring otherwise.

It was a good night.

*June 29th, 2005*
Finally saw Nat today after what felt like an eternity (it was literally just a week, but still). It was so hot outside I honestly thought I was going to evaporate on the sidewalk. We ended up hiding in the mall for most of the afternoon just to be near the AC.

I bought a blank CD so I can make a mix for Aaron’s birthday. It started as a joke, but Nat said I should actually do it, and now I kind of want to see what he thinks of the songs I picked. We talked about music so much at the mall the other day that it feels like the right kind of gift.

Forever Young - Alphaville
Float On - Modest Mouse
Take Me Out - Franz Ferdinand
Somebody Told Me - The Killers
Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Green Day
Dirty Little Secret - The All-American Rejects
03’ Bonnie & Clyde - Jay-Z, Beyoncé
In Too Deep - Sum 41
Ocean Avenue - Yellowcard

It’s kind of all over the place but in a good way, I think. Stuff he might actually listen to, not just things I like. I’m trying not to overthink it, but I keep wondering which songs he’ll comment on first.

Anyway, Nat’s coming over tomorrow so maybe I’ll finish it then. Or at least figure out if I want to add anything else before I burn the CD.

*July 5th, 2005*
I’m still tired from everything. Like my whole body feels warm and heavy. The Fourth was actually really good. We went to the lake and it was stupid hot and we all kept going into the water and then lying on our towels like seals. Nat and Jenna had already started drinking before we even set up and were laughing at literally nothing. Liam kept dropping stuff, which didn’t help.

I don’t know. It was fun. Just the whole group being loud and annoying and sunburnt and happy.

Alex’s basement afterward was even better. Movies, games, everyone yelling, the AC freezing us half to death. Nat got way too drunk. Like sloppy drunk. She kept telling me she loved me every ten minutes and then forgetting she’d said it. At one point she was holding onto my arm like she was going to float away. I took care of her because Jenna was trying to pretend she was fine (she absolutely wasn’t). It wasn’t a big deal. Just tiring.

I woke up early on the Fifth and somehow Aaron was the only other person awake. Everyone else was sprawled in a pile on the floor like they’d died. So we went outside. It was already warm and kind of quiet in that early-morning way where everything feels soft. He was… really easy to be around. I don’t know why that surprised me.

He sat next to me on the steps and our knees kept bumping and neither of us moved. I noticed that. I don’t know if he did. He probably didn’t. He just talked about nothing. The sky. How gross the basement smelled. How his shirt still felt damp. I could’ve stayed there forever honestly.

I gave him the mix. I didn’t plan to do it right then but it just sort of happened. He smiled in this small way and said he’d listen to it when he got home, and my stomach did this weird thing I don’t even want to admit. Like flipping. Or dropping?? Something embarrassing.

And now I keep thinking about it way too much. Like what if he doesn’t say anything about it. Or what if he does. I can’t decide which option is worse.

We had lunch and then Mom picked us up. Nat looked like a ghost. She practically melted into the backseat. I’m honestly so glad I don’t drink.

I don’t know why I feel so weird now. Not bad-weird. Just… different. I think something’s happening in my brain about Aaron and I don’t know what to do with that. I didn’t think I liked him like that. Maybe I still don’t. Or maybe I do and it’s just starting to hit me.

*July 29th, 2005*
I’m home and I feel like I can finally breathe normally again. Three weeks with my family is way too long. Nothing awful happened, but everything just felt cramped. Mom was on her “quality time” mission the entire trip and it made the whole house feel tight. She kept pushing for board games and long dinners and all of us doing everything together. Dad was trying so hard to make it all run smoothly that it just made the tension worse.

I think we’re one of those families that looks better from the outside. No one is yelling or anything, but it’s like we all have to act nicer and more patient than we actually are. I spent half the time sitting in whatever guest room we were staying in, reading or listening to music, while Sibling sat next to me playing games. That was the only part that felt normal.

There were moments I liked. Sitting by the lake in the morning before anyone else woke up was the best part. It was quiet and I didn’t have to pretend to be in a good mood. I think I learned that I don’t do well in “family togetherness” mode for this long. Maybe I never did, but this year it was really clear.

I missed Nat the whole time. I kept catching myself thinking, “Nat would laugh at this,” or wanting to tell her something stupid that happened, and then remembering the reception sucked. It was like having half my reactions stuck in my head with nowhere to go.

And I missed Aaron too, but in a different way. I didn’t think about it much until he texted me saying he got his license. He sent it like it was breaking news. I felt stupidly excited reading it. I wish I had been here when he told me.

Now that I’m back in my room, everything feels easier again. My space, my things, no pretending to be cheerful for relatives. I just want to see Nat and actually talk to her. And I want to see Aaron and hear about the license thing properly.

I don’t think I’m built for long trips with my family. I like them better in small doses. I don’t know what that says about me, but it’s true. For now I’m just glad to be home and around people who feel more like my life instead of a version of it I have to act out.

*July 31st, 2005*
I’m back from hanging out with Nat and now that everything’s calmed down I can actually think about last night. It was really nice. Aaron picked me up right at eight like he said he would, and he looked proud in this way he pretended wasn’t a thing. The air finally wasn’t awful, so we drove around with the windows down and listened to the mix and some of the CDs he made himself. His handwriting is terrible but the songs were good. We stopped for a bit near the cliffs and just sat there with the music playing quietly. It felt strangely safe. That’s the best word I have.

The only thing that threw me off was the car. Not the inside, but the dashboard on the passenger side has this dent in it now. Like someone hit something pretty hard. I made a joke about whether he’d already crashed his dad’s car, and he got weird immediately. Not angry, just stiff, like he didn’t want me to even ask. He said it wasn’t him so fast that it almost sounded rehearsed. Then he changed the subject. I didn’t push, but it felt strange. I wouldn’t normally care about something like that, but the way he reacted stuck with me.

I told Nat about it today. Just mentioned the dent and how he acted when I brought it up. She said it was probably nothing, maybe someone bumped it or his dad did and didn’t tell him, but she got quiet in this way that made me think she didn’t fully believe what she was saying. She tried to brush it off like she always does when she doesn’t want me to worry, but I can tell when she’s doing that. I don’t think it’s nothing. He looked uncomfortable in a way I’ve never seen from him before.

Besides that, the night was really good. Better than I expected. I keep replaying parts of it in my head even though I’m trying not to be weird about it. I don’t know if it was a date. It didn’t feel like just a ride, but I’m not going to overthink it right now.

*August 9th, 2005*
Aaron picked me up last night and Sibling would not stop staring out the window like it was the funniest thing ever. They didn’t say anything at first, just raised their eyebrows at me when I kept checking the mirror and fixing my hair. I told them to shut up and mind their own business, but they just grinned. And the worst part is that I think they were kind of right. I did want to look nice.

The drive was good. Quiet but good. He had another CD he made, and he put it in without asking, like he already knew I’d listen. It was mostly stuff I haven’t heard before, but I liked it. I like hearing what he listens to. It says a lot about someone without them having to explain anything.

We didn’t talk much at first, just sort of sat there while the air blew in through the windows. It felt comfortable though. I didn’t feel like I had to fill the silence or be entertaining.

He drove us back out toward the cliffs again. I think it’s “his spot” but I didn’t mind. We didn’t get out; we just stayed in the car with the headlights off. You could hear insects everywhere and the music was low, and for a second it felt like we were the only two people awake in the whole town.

He didn’t really talk about Olivia leaving. He said the house feels weird now, and then he changed the subject. I could tell he didn’t want to stay on it, so I didn’t push.

He dropped me off before it got too late and said he’d text me tomorrow. Maybe I’m just reading too much into things but I feel like he likes our drives too. I know I really do.

Either way, it was nice. I really like being around him.

*August 16th, 2005*
I haven’t written in a while and now everything feels piled up in my head, so I’m just trying to get it down before I forget how it felt.

The mall the other day was fun. Aaron left early and said it was because he had to walk his neighbor’s dog, which sounded like the dumbest excuse ever but I just said okay. I kept thinking about it later when Nat and Jenna were here for our sleepover and I asked about it but instead they basically cornered me and said, “You know you like him, right?” which was stupid because obviously I know. I didn’t want to say it though. It felt like once I said it, it would be real in a way that I can’t take back. But I said yes anyway.

Then the other day he asked if I wanted to hang out and I said yes right away. I didn’t even think about it. He took me to get food and we drove around again and it was comfortable. That’s the word I keep landing on. Everything feels easy when I’m with him, even when we’re not talking. He put on that CD he made and I kept trying not to stare at him when he was focused on the road.

And today we got our schedules and lockers and all that. Nat picked me up because I didn’t want to show up alone. But then I messaged Aaron and I told him I have his mom for AP English Lit and he said “good luck with that” which made me laugh more than it should have. Then he told me what classes he has and we actually have pre-calc together. And the same lunch. I tried not to freak out but I definitely did a little bit.

I don’t know. Everything feels so good right now, I don’t want summer to end. The last few days I’ve just felt happy in this quiet way I’m not used to. I like talking to him. I like being around him. I like that he keeps asking if I’m doing anything, even if sometimes he seems a little tired or distracted. I love the heat and the sunsets. I love watching movies with Nat and hanging out with everyone.

Mostly I’m just excited about school starting, which is insane because I’m taking so many APs I’ll probably die. But I get to see him more. And Nat. And maybe this year will feel different in a good way.

*August 18th, 2005*
We went to the lake today because Nat said it might be the last day warm enough to pretend it’s still July. It wasn’t actually cold, but the wind had that edge to it, the one that makes you wrap a towel around your shoulders instead of going in the water. It felt like summer sneaking away a little.

Aaron sat next to me. Not too close at first, just normal, and then at some point our towels were practically touching and I don’t remember when that happened. Our legs brushed a couple of times, and I told myself not to think anything about it, but of course that made me think about it more. He opened my water bottle for me because the cap was stuck, and he did it so easily, and then he smiled at me in this small way that made it impossible to actually be annoyed.

Mark was doing his whole Mark-thing with Nat. Leaning in, trying to make her laugh, kind of showing off. And Nat just kind of wasn’t biting. She didn’t seem annoyed, just sort of uninterested. I kept glancing between them wondering if I was imagining it. Mark is cute, and they look good next to each other, so I don’t get why she seemed so checked out. I need to ask her about it. I mean, imagine a future where me and Aaron date and Natalie and Makr do. That’d be amazing, very far fetched, but still the dream!

We stayed until the sun got low and the sand got cold. It felt more like the end of summer than the calendar says it is.

When we were leaving, Aaron walked with me back toward the parking lot. He didn’t say much, just kicked at the gravel and then said we should do another drive before school starts. I said yes faster than I meant to. My face was probably red, but luckily it was getting dark so he couldn’t tell.

It was a simple day but it feels stuck in my head now. Maybe because everything’s about to change again with school and schedules and actual responsibilities. Maybe because sitting next to him felt easier than it probably should.

*August 28th, 2005*
Last night was mostly good at first, which is why I keep thinking about it.

Nat came over to get ready here. We did the usual thing where we said we were going to be quick and then somehow it still took forever. She did her hair in my mirror and I kept changing my outfit and asking her if I looked stupid. She told me I looked fine, and then she stole my lipgloss like she always does. It felt normal. We were both in a good mood.

We walked over together and it was still warm outside, the kind of warm that makes you forget school is basically here. Nat kept talking the whole way, mostly about who was going to be there and whether it would be lame. I told her it probably would be, and she told me to stop being annoying.

When we got there it was already crowded, but it was fine at first. We found Jenna and Liam and a couple other people right away, and it turned into that thing where you end up in a circle in the kitchen and everyone’s laughing too loud because the music is too loud. Nat was actually having fun. She kept leaning into me and whispering comments about people, and I was laughing because half of it was true.

Someone handed us drinks. I had some. Not enough to feel anything, but enough to not feel like the only person holding a soda. For a while it was genuinely nice. We moved between the kitchen and the living room, and at one point Jenna was trying to get everyone to dance and it was stupid but not in a bad way. Mark showed up too and he was being normal and funny, so it didn’t feel awkward.

Then people started drifting off. Not all at once, just slowly. Someone went outside, someone went upstairs, someone disappeared into another room and didn’t come back. Nat got pulled away because someone wanted her to come “look at something” (which always means gossip) and she waved at me like she’d be right back.

She wasn’t right back.

Me and Mark ended up standing there alone for a bit, just the two of us, and it got kind of weird in that way where you can tell you’re both trying to act like it’s not weird. He made a couple jokes and I laughed, but it felt like we were just killing time.

So we said we’d go find everyone.

We checked the kitchen and didn’t see Nat. We checked outside and it was a bunch of people smoking and talking in circles like they were having the most important conversations of their lives. We walked around the hallway and it felt like every room was full of strangers even though I knew most of them.

That’s when we ran into Aaron.

He was really high. Like not just acting high. He looked out of it in a way I’ve never seen from him. His eyes kept unfocusing and he was swaying a little, like standing still was hard. Mark asked if he was okay and Aaron said something like “yeah” but it didn’t even sound convincing.

Mark took him outside to get air, because Aaron was leaning on him like he couldn’t stay upright on his own. I stood there for a second not knowing what to do, because I didn’t want to leave, but I also couldn’t stop thinking about Nat. I told Mark I was going to find her and he nodded like he understood.

Upstairs was packed and gross. I hated it immediately. It was too hot and everyone was pressed together and it felt like you couldn’t breathe properly. I found Nat in one of the bedrooms and some older guy had basically attached himself to her. She didn’t look scared exactly, just annoyed and trapped. When she saw me she looked relieved, which says enough.

I got her out of there. I didn’t make a big thing of it. I just grabbed her hand and said come on, and she came with me right away.

After that the night felt different. Nat stayed close to me and didn’t really talk much. She didn’t even make jokes about it later, which is not like her. I kept thinking about Aaron outside leaning on Mark and it made my stomach feel weird.

We left early. We didn’t even say goodbye to anyone, we just went. Outside felt better immediately.

I went home feeling kind of sick even though I didn’t really drink much. I still feel weird about it now. It’s like the first half of the night was genuinely fun and then at some point it shifted and I didn’t notice until it already had.

I don’t know what’s going on with Aaron. And I don’t know what to do with the Nat thing, because she didn’t want to talk about it. Maybe she will later. I hope so.

*August 29th, 2005*
First day back. Homeroom was the usual—new seats, handouts, everyone a little awkward. Aaron came in right before the bell and gave me a quick smile. He looked tired but better than last night. I wanted to ask if he was okay, but it didn’t feel like a hallway conversation. Maybe tomorrow, when it’s just the few minutes before attendance.

English Lit might actually be good. I have Aaron's mom. She’s strict in a calm way, not scary. First reading is Wuthering Heights. That made me weirdly happy because “Wuthering Heights” is my favorite Kate Bush song. I’ve always liked how it sounds like a storm. I’m curious if the book feels the same. We’re supposed to annotate the first three chapters and bring a quote for discussion.

The work already feels heavy:
- English: Wuthering Heights ch. 1–3 + one quote, start an outline for the first essay (due next week).
- Pre-calc: problem set #1, odds tonight (evens “recommended”).
- APUSH: chapter notes with key terms and a short timeline.
- Chem: safety contract + a half page of questions.

It’s only day one and my backpack is already full. I’ll start with pre-calc because numbers are easier when I’m tired, then read for English before bed. If I see Aaron in homeroom tomorrow, I’ll ask how he’s doing without making it a big deal. For now, I’m going to open the book and see if it lives up to the song.
